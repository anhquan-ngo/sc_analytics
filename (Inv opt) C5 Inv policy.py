# 1. Check whether we received an order at the beginning of the period
# (transit[ t-1,0] > 0). If so, we need to compute the cycle service level
# by checking if there was a stock-out last period. Remember, we define the
# cycle service level as the probability that there is no stock-out just before
# an order is received.
# 2. Update the on-hand inventory by subtracting the demand d[t] and
# adding the received inventory transit[t-1,0]
# 3. Indicate in stockout_period[t] whether we had a shortage.
# 4. Update the net inventory position net[t]. Remember that it is the total intransit inventory transit[t].sum() plus the on-hand inventory hand[t]
# Note that you can exclude backorders (i. e., excess demand will be lost) by
# uncommenting the line hand[t] = max(0,hand[t]).
# 5. Update the in-transit array by offsetting the values of the previous timestep
# by 1: transit[t,:-1] = transit[t-1,1:]. This represents the fact that
# the orders move through the supply pipeline.
# 6. If we are at the review period (t%R==0), we make an order based on the
# current net inventory position net[t] and the up-to level S. The order is
# then stored at the extreme of the in-transit array transit[t,L].
